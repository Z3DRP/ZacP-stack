			<h1><strong>A Taste of Italy</strong> in your neighborhood</h1>
			
			<p>Our recipies have been handed down from generation to generation</p>
			<aside><img src="Assets/Images/tasteoitaly.png" alt="Italian Shoreline" class="shoreline" /></aside>
			<p>We strive to bring authentic Italian cuisine to our customers. My great grandmother grew up in a small Italian village, when she
				came to America she brought her grandmother's recipes with her. Eating at <strong>Giovani's</strong> is like eating a home cooked
				meal cooked by my grandmother.</p>
